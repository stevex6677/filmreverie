# Film Reverie

An immersive 3D darkroom and illuminated light table experience for inspecting 35mm and 120 medium-format film in the browser.

Built with **React 18**, **Three.js**, and **React Three Fiber**.

## Features

### 1. 3D Darkroom & Illuminated Light Table
- **Interactive 3D Space:** Explore the virtual darkroom with intuitive look-around and approach navigation.
- **Physical Light Table:** Continuous dimmer controls, diffuse backlight transmission, and dynamic room lighting.
- **Whole-Strip Inversion:** Toggle between negative and positive modes across the entire physical strip, including borders, sprockets, and manufacturer markings.

### 2. Authentic Film Stocks & Rebate Markings
Faithfully modeled film characteristics, color gamuts, and edgeprints for five classic emulsions:
- **Kodak Portra 160, 400, and 800:** Fine grain, true orange mask normalization, and dual-track edge cadence.
- **Kodak Ektar 100:** Ultra-vivid color negative emulsion with high-contrast edge branding.
- **Kodak Ektachrome E100:** Reversal slide film with neutral clear base and positive-only viewing.

### 3. Physical Loupe & Optical Magnification
- **Tactile Inspection Loupe:** Drag to inspect fine film grain and edge markings across frames.
- **Magnification Modes:** Discrete presets (2.5x, 4x, 8x) and continuous optical macro zoom up to 1000%.
- **Fixed-Size Optical Barrel:** Authentic glass shading, feathered reflections, and distortion.

### 4. Flexible Roll Sizing & Multi-Format Support
- **Film Formats:** Support for **35mm** (36 × 24 mm) and **120 medium format** (6×4.5, 6×6, 6×7, 6×9).
- **Free-Sizing Mode:** Retains each image's native aspect ratio along a shared film height (24 mm for 35mm, 56 mm for 120).
- **Film Advance & Capacity:** Dynamic film span metering with a 230 mm strip-wrapping layout that scales to fit the table.
- **Multi-Device Navigation:** Responsive controls designed for mouse/keyboard on desktop and fluid touch gestures (pinch-to-zoom, pan, swipe) on iPad and mobile.

### 5. Standalone 3D Model Viewer
An isolated, reusable 3D model viewer module located in [`standalone/model-viewer/`](standalone/model-viewer/) for inspecting hardware models (such as the Mamiya Universal Press camera) with 360° rotation, preset views, and studio lighting.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** React 18 & TypeScript
- **3D Graphics & Shaders:** Three.js, `@react-three/fiber`, `@react-three/drei`
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **Testing:** Vitest & Playwright
- **Canvas / Image Processing:** `@napi-rs/canvas`, `pngjs`

### Light table camera angle

In Overview, choose **Adjust view**, then drag horizontally to yaw (±60°)
and vertically to tilt (0–50° from overhead). On desktop, **Shift-drag**
adjusts the angle without entering the mode. Scroll or pinch to zoom.
**Done** or **Escape** returns to normal panning; arrow keys adjust the angle
while the mode is active. **Top-down** resets only the angles, preserving
zoom and pan. Precision sliders are available under **Adjust**; double-click
either slider to reset that axis to 0°.

Frame focus and loupe inspection temporarily use an overhead view; returning
restores the browsing angle and framing. Camera roll remains locked.

Regression coverage: `npm run test:integration -- m18-table-angle` and
`npm run test:e2e -- m18-table-angle` (desktop, touch Chrome, and WebKit).
